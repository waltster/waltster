## Current Projects
### [The Digital Piranesi](https://digitalpiranesi.org) - Center for Digital Humanities, UofSC
The Digital Piranesi (digitalpiranesi.org) is a continuing project that encompasses the disciplines of historical analysis, architecture, library science, graphical art, and literature. The project exists to provide high-quality digital editions of eighteenth-century artist and architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s rare prints, housed in the Ernest F. Hollings Special Collections Library. While the project is ongoing, there are extensive opportunities for the application of novel research in the development of new technologies.

The project involves researching the foundational technologies of digital humanities scholarship and digital content management, developing customized software solutions to implement these technologies into the Digital Piranesi project, and deploying this software and resulting materials for public use. The question posed is how can custom digital content annotation software be combined with existing implementations of digital standards in a way that is capable of adding overlays to existing images of Piranesi’s work and rendering these images in a loss-less quality zoom-capable viewer.
